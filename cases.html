                <p >A computer case, also known as a computer chassis, is the enclosure that contains most of the components of a personal computer 
                    (usually excluding the display, keyboard, and mouse). Cases are usually constructed from steel (often SECC—steel, electrogalvanized, 
                    cold-rolled, coil), aluminium and plastic. Other materials such as glass, wood, acrylic and even Lego bricks have appeared in home-built cases.</p>
                
                <p>Cases can come in many different sizes (known as form factors). The size and shape of a computer case are usually determined by the form factor of 
                the motherboard since it is the largest component of most computers. Cases are also referred to by their size (such as ATX case, Mini ITX case, etc.) 
                Consequently, personal computer form factors typically specify only the internal dimensions and layout of the case. Form factors for rack-mounted and 
                blade servers may include precise external dimensions as well since these cases must themselves fit in specific enclosures.</p>

            <td colspan="2"><p>For example, a case designed for an ATX motherboard and power supply may take on several external forms such as a vertical tower 
            (designed to sit on the floor, height > width), a flat desktop (height < width) or pizza box (height ≤ 5 cm (2 in) designed to sit on the desk under 
            the computer's monitor). Full-size tower cases are typically larger in volume than desktop cases, with more room for drive bays, expansion slots, and 
            custom or all-in-one (AIO) water cooling solutions. Desktop cases—and mini-tower cases under about 46 cm (18 in) high—are popular in business environments 
            where space is at a premium.</p></td>
