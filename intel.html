    <p> Intel Corporation, commonly known as <b>Intel</b>, is an American multinational corporation and technology company headquartered in Santa Clara, California.
    It is the world's largest semiconductor chip manufacturer by revenue, and is one of the developer of the x86 series of instruction sets, the instruction 
    sets found in most personal computers (PCs).

    <p>Intel's first products were shift register memory and random-access memory integrated circuits, and Intel grew to be a leader in the fiercely competitive 
        DRAM, SRAM, and ROM markets throughout the 1970s. Concurrently, Intel engineers Marcian Hoff, Federico Faggin, Stanley Mazor and Masatoshi Shima invented 
        Intel's first microprocessor. Originally developed for the Japanese company Busicom to replace a number of ASICs in a calculator already produced by Busicom, 
        the Intel 4004 was introduced to the mass market on November 15, 1971, though the microprocessor did not become the core of Intel's business until the mid-1980s.
