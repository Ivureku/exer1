            <td><p><b>PCI Express (Peripheral Component Interconnect Express)</b>, officially abbreviated as PCIe or PCI-e,is a high-speed 
                serial computer expansion bus standard, designed to replace the older PCI, PCI-X and AGP bus standards. It is the common 
                motherboard interface for personal computers' graphics cards, hard disk drive host adapters, SSDs, Wi-Fi and Ethernet hardware connections.
                PCIe has numerous improvements over the older standards, including higher maximum system bus throughput, lower I/O pin count 
                and smaller physical footprint, better performance scaling for bus devices, a more detailed error detection and reporting mechanism 
                (Advanced Error Reporting, AER), and native hot-swap functionality. More recent revisions of the PCIe standard provide hardware 
                support for I/O virtualization.</p>

                    <p>The PCI Express electrical interface is measured by the number of simultaneous lanes. (A lane is a single send/receive line of data. 
                        The analogy is a highway with traffic in both directions.) The interface is also used in a variety of other standards — most notably 
                        the laptop expansion card interface called ExpressCard. It is also used in the storage interfaces of SATA Express, U.2 (SFF-8639) and M.2</p>

                    <p>A PCI Express card fits into a slot of its physical size or larger (with ×16 as the largest used), but may not fit into a smaller 
                        PCI Express slot; for example, a ×16 card may not fit into a ×4 or ×8 slot. Some slots use open-ended sockets to permit physically longer cards and negotiate the best available electrical and logical connection.</p>
