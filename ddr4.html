                <p><b>RAM</b> or Random-Access Memory is a form of computer memory that can be read and changed in any order, typically used to store working data and machine code.
                    A random-access memory device allows data items to be read or written in almost the same amount of time irrespective of the physical location of data inside the 
                    memory, in contrast with other direct-access data storage media (such as hard disks, CD-RWs, DVD-RWs and the older magnetic tapes and drum memory), where the time 
                    required to read and write data items varies significantly depending on their physical locations on the recording medium, due to mechanical limitations such as 
                    media rotation speeds and arm movement.

                <p>Double Data Rate 4 Synchronous Dynamic Random-Access Memory (DDR4 SDRAM) is a type of synchronous dynamic random-access memory with a high bandwidth ("double data rate") 
                    interface.</p>
                <p>Released to the market in 2014, it is a variant of dynamic random-access memory (DRAM), of which some have been in use since the early 1970s, and a higher-speed successor 
                    to the DDR2 and DDR3 technologies. DDR4 is not compatible with any earlier type of random-access memory (RAM) due to different signaling voltage and physical interface, besides 
                    other factors.</p>
