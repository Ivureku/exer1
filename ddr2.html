                <p><b>RAM</b> or Random-Access Memory is a form of computer memory that can be read and changed in any order, typically used to store working data and machine code.
                    A random-access memory device allows data items to be read or written in almost the same amount of time irrespective of the physical location of data inside the 
                    memory, in contrast with other direct-access data storage media (such as hard disks, CD-RWs, DVD-RWs and the older magnetic tapes and drum memory), where the time 
                    required to read and write data items varies significantly depending on their physical locations on the recording medium, due to mechanical limitations such as 
                    media rotation speeds and arm movement.</p>

                <p>Double Data Rate 2 Synchronous Dynamic Random-Access Memory (DDR2 SDRAM) is a double data rate (DDR) synchronous dynamic random-access memory (SDRAM) interface. 
                   It superseded the original DDR SDRAM specification, and was itself superseded by DDR3 SDRAM (launched in 2007). DDR2 DIMMs are neither forward compatible with DDR3 
                  nor backward compatible with DDR.</p>
                <p>The key difference between DDR2 and DDR SDRAM is the increase in prefetch length. In DDR SDRAM, the prefetch length was two bits for every bit in a word; whereas it 
                is four bits in DDR2 SDRAM. During an access, four bits were read or written to or from a four-bit-deep prefetch queue.</p>
