            <td><p><b>Memory Bank</b>, is a logical unit of storage in electronics, which is hardware-dependent. In a computer, the memory bank may be 
                determined by the memory controller along with physical organization of the hardware memory slots. In a typical synchronous dynamic random-access 
                memory (SDRAM) or double data rate SDRAM (DDR SDRAM), a bank consists of multiple rows and columns of storage units, and is usually spread out 
                across several chips. In a single read or write operation, only one bank is accessed, therefore the number of bits in a column or a row, per bank 
                and per chip, equals the memory bus width in bits (single channel). The size of a bank is further determined by the number of bits in a column and 
                a row, per chip, multiplied by the number of chips in a bank.</p>

                    <p>Some computers have several identical memory banks of RAM, and use bank switching to switch between them. Harvard architecture 
                        computers have (at least) two very different banks of memory, one for program storage and other for data storage.</p>
